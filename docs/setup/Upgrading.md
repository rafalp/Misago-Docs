Upgrading your Misago to latest version
=======================================

To upgrade your Misago site, connect to the server, `cd` to `misago_docker` directory, and run following commands:

1. `git pull`
2. `./appctl upgrade`

`git pull` will download latest version of Misago from the GitHub, and `./appctl upgrade` will run upgrades.

You may be asked by `git pull` to "identify yourself". If this is the case, simply follow the instructions on screen to set your GitHub e-mail.
