Core Settings
=============

Those settings are set in `settings.py` file with defaults defined in `misago.conf.defaults` module. 


## `MISAGO_403_IMAGE`

Url (relative to `STATIC_URL`) to file that should be served if user has no permission to see requested attachment.


## `MISAGO_404_IMAGE`

Url (relative to `STATIC_URL`) to file that should be served if user has requested nonexistant attachment.


## `MISAGO_ACL_EXTENSIONS`

List of Misago ACL framework extensions.


## `MISAGO_ADMIN_NAMESPACES`

Link namespaces that are administrator-only areas that require additional security from Misago. Users will have to re-authenticate themselves to access those namespaces, even if they are already signed in your frontend. In addition they will be requested to reauthenticated if they were inactive in those namespaces for certain time.

Defautly `misago:admin` and `admin` namespaces are specified, putting both Misago and Django default admin interfaces under extended security mechanics.


## `MISAGO_ADMIN_PATH`

Path prefix for Misago administration backend. Defautly "admincp", but you may set it to empty string if you with to disable your forum administration backend.


## `MISAGO_ADMIN_SESSION_EXPIRATION`

Maximum allowed lenght of inactivity period between two requests to admin namespaces. If its exceeded, user will be asked to sign in again to admin backed before being allowed to continue activities.


## `MISAGO_ANONYMOUS_USERNAME`

Anonymous name used to replace deleted user's name in places that are keeping it. Defaults to "Ghost".


## `MISAGO_ATTACHMENT_IMAGE_SIZE_LIMIT`

Max dimensions (width and height) of user-uploaded images embedded in posts. If uploaded image is greater than dimensions specified in this settings, Misago will generate thumbnail for it.


##### Note

Because user-uploaded GIF's may be smaller than dimensions specified, but still be considerably heavy due to animation, Misago always generates thumbnails for user-uploaded GIFS, stripping the animations from them.


## `MISAGO_ATTACHMENT_ORPHANED_EXPIRE`

How old (in minutes) should attachments unassociated with any be before they'll automatically deleted by `clearattachments` task.


## `MISAGO_ATTACHMENT_SECRET_LENGTH`

Length of attachment's secret (filenames and url token). The longer, the harder it is to bruteforce, but too long may conflict with your uploaded files storage limits (eg. filesystem path length limits).


##### Warning

In order for Misago to support clustered deployments or CDN's (like Amazon's S3), its unable to validate user's permission to see the attachment at its source. Instead it has to rely on exessively long and hard to guess urls to attachments and assumption that your users will not "leak" source urls to attachments further.

Generaly, neither you nor your users should use forums to exchange files containing valuable data, but if you do, you should make sure to secure it additionaly via other means like password-protected archives or file encryption solutions.


## `MISAGO_AVATAR_GALLERY`

Path to directory containing avatar galleries. Those galleries can be loaded by running `loadavatargallery` command.

Feel free to remove existing galleries or add your own.

If you create gallery named `__default__` and set avatar gallery as default user avatar, Misago will select new users avatars from it while keeping this gallery hidden from existing users.


## `MISAGO_AVATARS_SIZES`

Misago uses avatar cache that prescales avatars to requested sizes. Enter here sizes to which those should be optimized.


##### Warning

It's impossible to regenerate user avatars store for existing avatars. Misago comes with sane defaults for avatar sizes, with min. height for user avatar being 400 pixels square, and steps of 200, 150, 100, 64, 50 and 30px. However if you need larger avatar or different pregenerated dimensions, changing those will require you to manually remove `avatars` directory from your media storage as well as running `misago.users.avatars.set_default_avatar` function against every user registered.
